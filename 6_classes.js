*Es6 Classes
Class âˆ’ A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. 
A class encapsulates data for the object. 

Classes are in fact "special functions",
 and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, 
 the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.
